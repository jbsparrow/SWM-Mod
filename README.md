# SWM-Mod
A mod for Script-Ware Mac. Matches with the Deep Blue theme I made. Also has some easter eggs.

## How to use

Navigate to `/Applications/Script-Ware.app/Contents/Resources/` and replace the orignal `update.asar` with the `update.asar` file downloaded from the github, then restart Script-Ware. 

I recommend using this in combination with my SWM theme, also on the GitHub page, as it's designed to be used with it. Without it, some things may look unusual.

##### Default SWM Easter eggs:
- jjsploitwinning: Typing `jjsploitwinning` in the editor will make Script-Ware play an audio saying that a virus has been detected. It also makes a toast that says that the virus is being quarantined.
- iloveicepools: Typing `iloveicepools`, `i<3icepools`, `<3icepools`, or `icepools<3` in the editor will redirect you to the fbi's website (https://fbi.gov) and show a toast saying that you're being redirected to the fbi's website.
- heisinmyeyes: Typing `heisinmyeyes` in the editor and clicking the Execute button will play *I Just Threw Out the Love of My Dreams* by Weezer forever. To stop it, reload Script-Ware.

##### Custom Easter Eggs:
- femboys: Typing `femboys`, `astolfo`, or `femboys>women` in the editor and clicking the Execute button will play *I turned a bad copypasta into a bad rap* by Senzawa. It will also send a toast saying "Femboys > Women" and create a notification reading "Femboys > Women".
- smack: Typing `smack` in the editor and clicking Execute will play an audio snippet from CupcaKke's song *Vagina*, the clip says "Smack my ass like a drum". The nudge noise is replaced by this sound.
- emergency: Typing `vshawkjsdhwuhuh` in the editor and clicking Execute will enable emergency mode, locking Script-Ware. To exit this, reload Script-Ware.
