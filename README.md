# SWM-Mod
A mod for Script-Ware M. Matches with the Deep Blue theme I made. Also has some easter eggs.

## How to use

Navigate to `/Applications/Script-Ware.app/Contents/Resources/` and replace the orignal `update.asar` with the `update.asar` file downloaded from the github. Then restart Script-Ware. 

I recommend using this in combination with my SWM theme, also on the GitHub page, as it's designed to be used with it. Without it, some things may look unusual.
